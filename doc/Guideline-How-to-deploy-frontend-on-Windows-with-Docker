# Guideline: How to deploy frontend on Windows with Docker
Although the frontend code is expected to deploy on a Linux server for production usage, you can also deploy and run it on a Windows computer for local test. Let's have a look on how it works with docker.

## 1 Prerequisites
1. A computer with Windows10 or Windows11.
2. WSL2 is installed. Please refer to [Guideline: Install WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/wsl/install).
3. Docker for Windows is installed. Please refer to [Quick start: Docker for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-containers).
4. Ensure there is a Dockerfile under the project root directory. Create it with content below if it does not exist.
    ```
    FROM node:14.17
    COPY . /projmural
    WORKDIR /projmural
    RUN npm install && npm run build
    EXPOSE 3000
    CMD npm run start:client
    ```
## 2 Build frontend with Docker
1. Open powershell and ensure you are under the project root directory.
2. Create a docker image with _./Dockerfile_.
    ```
    docker build -t frontend:v1 .
    ```
3. If you need to recreate a docker image, please follow the commands below.
    ```
    docker rmi -f frontend:v1
    docker build -t frontend:v1 .
    ```

## 3 Run frontend with Docker
1. Please ensure you have created a docker image called frontend:v1.
2. Then you can run a docker container using the image called frontend:v1.
    ```
    docker run -p 3000:3000 frontend:v1
    ```
